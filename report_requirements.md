# YelpInsighters: Report

## Project deliverables: guidelines
### Here is what you should include in your presentations and reports:

Reports (send by email):
Link to GitHub repository, mit.cs.uchicago.edu repository, or other location where all your code is available
- Description of data set, including size in GB and number of records, defined in a way that is appropriate for your specific project
- Hypotheses you tested
- Algorithms you used (description of concept, not implementation: e.g., this is "k-means clustering," not "MapReduce")
- Big Data approaches used (e.g. "MapReduce")
- if possible, cite extrapolated runtimes to demonstrate why running on a single machine would take prohibitively long
- any Big Data related tools or techniques you learned that we did not cover in lecture
- challenges you faced, and which you successfully overcame or worked around, and which you were unable to
- the results you got
- "how did you find your data set?": Students asked me for advice on finding data sets, and I realized that none of last year's groups told me how they found theirs. What advice would you give to next year's students on how to find a suitable data set, based on how you found yours?

Presentation slides should be emailed to me, but you can wait until the presentation to send them

Presentation:
- 15 minutes
- all group members must be present and participate
- only show what you have actually accomplished as of the presentation, or, at the very least, make it crystal clear if any parts are anticipated to be completed later before your deadline
- once rooms are announced, I urge you to visit the room sometime when it is not occupied and test the projector with your computer; many people are surprised to learn what kinds of connections do or do not exist in our rooms (you have the department's permission to use the room for doing this and if anyone challenges you, please tell them that we gave you this permission)
- 15 minutes = about 7 slides
- show code sparingly, if at all; only show code if you think a technique will be of genuine interest to most in attendance due to something unusual; you do not need to show code just for the sake of showing code (I'll be reading all of it anyway)

Here is suggested content; note that you have discretion on how to build a compelling presentation:
- basic Description of data set, here's how big it is
- hypotheses
- Algorithms you used; conceptual overview if it is not familiar to the class; explain differences from stock algorithm if you took a standard algorithm and customized it
- Big Data approaches used (e.g. "MapReduce"); brief description of how you got the algorithm working if it would be instructive to others (e.g. "we used key-value pairs that were names of people as the key and whether they were a visitor or a visitee as the value")
- if possible, cite extrapolated runtimes to demonstrate why running on a single machine would take prohibitively long
- any Big Data related tools or techniques you learned that we did not cover in lecture, similarly, anything else you think your fellow students would find interesting or good to know
- challenges
- the results you got
